The Department of Computer Science at the University of Cologne is working on a new system
to manage exercise group distribution (EGD). Right now, each lecturer handles the process
differently, and many students feel it’s unfair. Often, students who are quick to register get
their preferred groups, while others end up with sessions that don’t fit their schedules. This
causes frustration, especially for those who need a particular group due to conflicts with other
courses. In this new system, lecturers will be able to create exercise groups for their courses.
They will set group details like session times and the number of students each group can
handle. Students will log in to view available sessions. They can register for all courses they
want to attend exercises for in one semester. Instead of a priority system, the Computer
Science Department rather wants students to mark times where they are NOT available due
to other circumstances. The system will then distribute students across groups in a fair
manner, considering their available time slots and any schedule conflicts they may have with
other courses. The system will try to minimize the number of students that could not be
assigned a group. If a student could not be assigned, manual administration will be necessary.
Notifications will let students know which groups they’ve been assigned to. In future versions
of the system, it should also be possible to register as a group for single lectures or multiple at
once, but that is of low priority. Initially, the number of students using the system will be below
1000, but if it proves useful, the system might be adopted university-wide. Thus, it should also
be able to adopt to handle thousands of students, especially during registration periods. The
software should be easy to use for students as well as lecturers and system admins. Security will
be a priority, with access controlled through university credentials (Shibboleth) and personal
data protected from unauthorized access. The chair of Software & Systems Engineering wants
to let students participate in the development of the system, both as developers as well as
testers. Thus, the system should be developed in Java. The system should be deployed in
winter semester 2026/27, so first test versions should be ready in beginning of winter semester
2025/26. The overall budget available for the whole system development is 70,000 euro.

Zusammenfassung:

- Abteilung für Informatik möchte neues System zur Gruppenverteilung (EGD) entwickeln

- Status Quo:
    - Jeder Dozent hat anderen Prozess zur EGD, lässt Studenten teilweise unfair behandelt fühlen
    - EGD oft nach dem Prinzip first come first serve
    - Führt zu Frustration weil langsame Studis nicht gewünschten Platz bekommen
    - Haben ggf. keine Zeit an den restlichen freien Terminen und geraten in Konflikt mit anderen Terminen

- Neues System zur EGD
    - Dozenten können Gruppen für Ihren Kurs erstellen
    - Können Gruppendetails wie Tag & Uhrzeit und max. Teinehmeranzahl bestimmen
    - Studenten können sich in System einloggen und verfügbare Kurse ansehen
    - Studenten können sich für alle Kurse anmelden, für die sie im Semester eine Übung besuchen wollen
    - Sollen danach alle Termine angeben, an denen sie NICHT teilnehmen können
    - System versucht dann Studenten zu verteilen
